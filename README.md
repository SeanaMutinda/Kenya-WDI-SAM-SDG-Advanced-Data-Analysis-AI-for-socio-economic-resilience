# Socio-Economic Resilience and Sustainability Assessment of Kenya

## Project Overview

This repository presents a **master’s-level, policy-oriented socio-economic analysis of Kenya**, structured to align with **World Bank analytical, transparency, and reproducibility standards**. The project integrates **macroeconomic indicators (World Development Indicators – WDI)**, **structural economic analysis (Social Accounting Matrix – SAM)**, and **sustainability metrics (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs)** to assess Kenya’s economic resilience, structural linkages, and sustainability performance.

The analysis is implemented in a fully reproducible Python-based workflow and is designed to support **evidence-based policy evaluation**, **development planning**, and **academic research**.

---

## Objectives

The core objectives of this project are to:

1. Analyse Kenya’s macroeconomic and financial performance using World Bank WDI indicators.
2. Examine structural inter-sectoral linkages and multiplier effects through SAM-based analysis.
3. Evaluate Kenya’s progress toward sustainable development using SDG indicators.
4. Provide an integrated, policy-relevant narrative consistent with World Bank analytical practices.

## Analytical Framework

The study follows a **multi-phase analytical framework**, consistent with development economics and World Bank country diagnostics:

### Phase I: Macroeconomic and Financial Analysis (WDI)

* Descriptive and trend analysis of key macroeconomic indicators
* Growth, inflation, fiscal balance, and external sector assessment
* Identification of structural vulnerabilities and resilience patterns

### Phase II: Structural Economic Analysis (SAM)

* Construction and interpretation of SAM-based sectoral linkages
* Multiplier analysis to identify high-impact sectors
* Assessment of production, income, and demand transmission channels

### Phase III: Sustainability and SDG Performance

* Mapping national indicators to SDG targets
* Normalisation and comparative performance analysis
* Identification of sustainability gaps and policy priorities

---

## Data Sources

All data sources comply with **World Bank data transparency and credibility requirements**:

* **World Development Indicators (WDI)** – World Bank
* **Social Accounting Matrix (SAM)** – National and international statistical sources
* **SDG Indicators** – United Nations Statistics Division

Where applicable, metadata definitions follow official international standards to ensure consistency and comparability.

## Methodology

* Quantitative analysis implemented in **Python**
* Data cleaning, transformation, and validation performed systematically
* Missing data addressed using transparent and documented imputation techniques
* Results interpreted using established economic theory and development policy frameworks

All analytical steps are documented within the notebook to ensure **full reproducibility**, a core World Bank requirement.

## Key Outputs

* Macroeconomic trends and diagnostic indicators
* Sectoral multipliers and structural linkage matrices
* SDG performance indices and sustainability diagnostics
* Policy-relevant insights grounded in empirical evidence

---

## Policy Relevance

This project is explicitly designed to mirror **World Bank country diagnostic reports** by:

* Emphasising data credibility and transparency
* Linking empirical results to development policy questions
* Supporting evidence-based decision-making

Findings can inform:

* National development strategies
* Sectoral investment prioritisation
* Sustainability and SDG-aligned policy design

---

## Reproducibility and Transparency

In line with World Bank research standards:

* All data sources are publicly accessible
* Analytical methods are explicitly documented
* Results can be independently replicated

Users are encouraged to review the notebook for methodological details and assumptions.

---

## Limitations

* Results depend on data availability and quality
* SAM analysis reflects structural relationships for the reference year
* SDG indicators may not fully capture sub-national disparities

These limitations are acknowledged in line with best practices in development research.

---

## Ethics and Data Use

* No confidential or personally identifiable data are used
* All data sources are cited and comply with open-data principles
* Analysis is conducted solely for academic and policy research purposes
